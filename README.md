# tdd-javascript

The assignment is to fix the failing tests.

You'll need to clone this repo and set it up in your htdocs folder locally, but [here is a demo](http://karma-tech-consulting.github.io/tdd-javascript/)

You could also complete the assignment [on JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/kbjwLsab/12/) (from this [SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27367920/how-can-i-get-started-with-mocha-and-make-my-first-test/27367921#27367921))
